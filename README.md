# widget-app-email
A widget attraction generator based on an input of a city and API's of a certain company. 

When I was on an internship in "Bridgify" I was given the assigment of creating a widget generator for a client to use inside their email templates. This project was needed to be done with vanilla JS, making it more challenging than I thought at first, when I was certain I could use libraries. Having a look at the code, you can see I used 'table' tags instead of 'div' tags, becuase div tags are not readable in most emails. the styling was not an easy job considering I could not use "bootstrap", "Flex Box" "Grid" and such. Inline css was necessary because again, external css files are not readable in emails. Most of the styling was done dynamically through the index.js file. The fetching_functions.js file was really a fun code to write. Using async/await, thinking few steps ahead because of the complexed functions and having to to connect it with the API's. Learned a lot from this project and I am happy to share it. Note that real API's, secrets and tokens are replaced with dummy strings because I cannot share that sensitive information.
